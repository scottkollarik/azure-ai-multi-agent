# Context Summaries - Organization Guide

This folder has been reorganized to better separate different types of documentation.

## New Organization Structure

### üìÅ `docs/daily-summaries/` - Daily Development Summaries
- **Progress tracking:** Daily accomplishments and discoveries
- **Troubleshooting reference:** Solutions to common problems
- **Configuration documentation:** Environment setup and changes
- **Development history:** Chronological record of project evolution

**Example:** `2025-06-25-azure-ai-travel-agents-setup-and-chaos-agent-vision.md`

## Why This Organization?

- **Clear separation** between daily work and broader concepts
- **Better discoverability** of different types of content
- **Appropriate context** for each type of document
- **Scalable structure** as the project grows

## Usage Guidelines

- **Daily work:** Use `docs/daily-summaries/` for chronological development records
- **Naming:** Follow the established conventions in each folder's README
- **Cross-references:** Link between daily summaries and conceptual ideas when relevant

## Migration

All existing content has been moved to the appropriate new locations:
- ‚úÖ Daily summaries ‚Üí `docs/daily-summaries/`
- ‚úÖ README files ‚Üí Updated to reflect new structure

## Naming Convention

Files are named using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`

Examples:
- `2025-06-25-azure-ai-travel-agents-setup-and-chaos-agent-vision.md`
- `2025-06-26-mcp-tool-integration-troubleshooting.md`
- `2025-07-01-chaos-agent-prototype-development.md`

## Why This Structure?

- **Date-based ordering:** Files sort chronologically in any file browser
- **Descriptive titles:** Easy to find specific topics
- **Markdown format:** Preserves formatting and structure
- **Avoids UI parsing:** Keeps summaries as raw files rather than parsed content

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Create summaries** for significant technical sessions
2. **Include key discoveries** and configuration details
3. **Document future visions** and roadmap items
4. **Preserve troubleshooting steps** that might be needed again
5. **Add to this README** when new summary types are established

## Current Summaries
